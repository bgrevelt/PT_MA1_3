## Todo by me

- Write a formula generator for random testing of properties of propositional logic?
- Formulate a number of relevant properties (don't know how much) to test. Either with QuickCheck or my own random formula generator.
- Should I implement my own random formula generator or should I make use of QuickCheck?

# Ideas
This chapter will state the ideas that I have with regard to testable properties.
- A property that will test the output once the formula has been converted from DNF to CNF.
- The same as above, but with a slight difference: a property that will test the output once it has been converted from CNF to DNF.
