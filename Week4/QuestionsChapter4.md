# Questions Chapter 4


Time spent: 2 hours

##Question 1
In chapter 4.4 the definitions of intersection, union and difference are shown, but what is the definition of complement? It's not clear for me what this means.

##Question 2
The book states: "In most cases you will have that a != { a }" next the remark explains that there are solutions but that they hold the form: 

> *a = {{{ ... }}}*

Does this mean that there are an infinite amount of sets within these sets. Where have the 1's gone?

##Question 3
Page 134: the graph. This makes sense except for the functions on the axes. What are Ran(R) and Dom(R)?
