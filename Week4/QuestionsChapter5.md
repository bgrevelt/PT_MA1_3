# Questions Chapter 5


Time spent: 2 hours


##Question 1
In the book I read the following:

>*Definition 5.7 (Identity and Inverse)*
>
>*∆<sub>A</sub> ={(a,b)∈A^2 |a=b}={(a,a)|a∈A} is a relation on A,the identity on A.*

I assume ∆<sub>A</sub> is de means the identity of A. 

What does the identity of A actually means?

##Question 2
Do we need to know the differences between pre-order, strict partial order, partial order, total order and equivalence?


##Question 3
I do not understand Example 5.43. Because I do not understand ∈^+. Could this be explained?

> Example 5.43 	
> 
> If A={a,{b,{c}}},then
> >a ∈^+ A, {b,{c}} ∈^+ A, b ∈^+ A, {c} ∈^+ A and c ∈^+ A. 

##Question 4
What does the sign ⊢ mean?
What does the sign |= mean?

##Question 5
y@(y:ys). What does this mean?

##Question 6
R^−1 means symmetric, R^* means transitive and reflexive.

What does R^+ mean?
