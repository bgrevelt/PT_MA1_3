##Question 1
In the book I read the following:

>*Definition 5.7 (Identity and Inverse)*
>
>*∆<sub>A</sub> ={(a,b)∈A^2 |a=b}={(a,a)|a∈A} is a relation on A,the identity on A.*

I assume ∆<sub>A</sub> is de means the identity of A. 
What does the identity of A actually means?

##Question 2
Do we need to know the differences between pre-order, strict partial order, partial order, total order and equivalence?


##Question 3
I do not understand Example 5.43. Because I do not understand ∈<sup>+</sup>. Could this be explained?

> Example 5.43 	
> 
> If A={a,{b,{c}}},then
> 
>a ∈<sup>+</sup> A, {b,{c}} ∈<sup>+</sup> A, b ∈<sup>+</sup> A, {c} ∈<sup>+</sup> A and c ∈<sup>+</sup> A. 

##Question 4
