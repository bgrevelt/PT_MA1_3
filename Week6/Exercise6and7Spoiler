Exercise 6
Carmichael numbers try to fool Fermat's little theorem by using composites. Miller-Rabin primality check returns:
 - Is probably prime
 - Is composite
 
Note the part where it knows for sure if it is a composite number. The findings are pretty obvious.

Exercise 7
"The recipe: take a prime p, and use the Miller-Rabin algorithm to check whether 2pâˆ’1 is also prime"

Take a list of primes and for each prime p

isPrime(2^p - 1) == True then it's mersenne prime

instead of isPrime you use the MR function. Testing this is a pain for your computer so make sure to test with take x func.

Example mersenne primes.
p        M
2        3
3        7
5        31
7        127
