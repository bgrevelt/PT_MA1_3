-- The function to generate Carmichael numbers as given in the assignment
carmichael :: [Integer]
carmichael = [ (6*k+1)*(12*k+1)*(18*k+1) | 
    k <- [2..], 
    isPrime (6*k+1), 
    isPrime (12*k+1), 
    isPrime (18*k+1) ]


{- 
Exercise 6 (the first exercise 6)
Findings: if you execute the Miller-Rabin primality test on the carmichael numbers (exercise6_1) it returns false. 
So the carmichael numbers easily fools the Fermat's primality check, but not that easy the Miller-Rabin primality check. In this case we 
pass the parameter k the value 20. At least 3/4 of the bases k are witnesses for the compositeness of n. We could say that 
the probabillity is 99,99999999990905%. The calculation for the probability is (4^20)/100 - 100). There is still the possibillity to give 
a false positive. These are called Miller-Rabin pseudoprimes or strong pseudoprimes.

	Exercise 6 (the second exercise 6)

	if you feed the Miller-Rabin primality test with a list of primes and you do for every prime the following: 2^prime-1 
	(exercise6_2) it returns the list below within 10 minutes. This corresponds with the mersenne primes on http://www.mersenne.org/primes
